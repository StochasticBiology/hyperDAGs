Title: Hypercubic directed acyclic graphs for accumulation modelling
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kostas Giannakis and Iain Johnston
Maintainer: Iain Johnston <aeioun@gmail.com>
Description: Given a dataset of binary string observations, can we construct an arborescence with minimal branching that is a subset of the hypercubic digraph and hits all the vertices corresponding to datapoints? Yes -- the "Gutin algorithm" will do this in polynomial time https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-68880-8_23 , https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-94830-0_5 .
    Given a dataset of paired binary string observations, can we construct a DAG with minimal branching that is a subset of the hypercubic digraph, hits all the vertices corresponding to datapoints, and has a path going from ancestor to descendant for each pair? That is what we are trying to find here.
